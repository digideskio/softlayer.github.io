# softlayer.github.io

## Branches
### source
This branch is the source Hugo uses to generate the HTML for the site. All content, template, config, and functional changes should be pushed to this repo.

### master
The master branch contains the HTML that gh-pages uses to publish the site to softlayer.github.io. Anything in the master branch will be accessible from the public URL. No templates or Hugo files should be in this branch, only release ready HTML generated by Hugo.

## Contrib
PRs are more than welcome for functional changes and modification/addition of examples. All additions and modifications should be made to the source branch. PRs for the master branch will not be accepted.
