# softlayer.github.io

## Contrib
Examples and modifications are welcome to both the source branche. 

### Testing
```hugo server -w``` is often used in testing. All links generated by the server will be for localhost. It is necessary to run ```hugo``` before committing to the master branch to ensure the links are generated with the proper domain.
### Branches
#### source
This branch is the source Hugo uses to generate the HTML for the site. All content, template, config, and functional changes should be pushed to this repo.

#### master
The master branch contains the HTML that gh-pages uses to publish the site to softlayer.github.io. Anything in the master branch will be accessible from the public URL. No templates or Hugo files should be in this branch, only release ready HTML generated by Hugo.
